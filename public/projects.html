                With the help of React (along with webpack and babel) this utility will find, retrieve and display video data based on search terms and a few options. Jobs are created in the NodeJS backend using Bull, where each job performs a web scraping task with Puppeteer, which runs a headless browser which will search google for the term, visit each url of the search and retrieve the video along with a dialogue transcript if available. Search requests can be done simultaneously, can be cancelled and each video can be removed from the results list once no longer needed.

            <div class="description">
                This website uses transcriptions of dozens of events from a spiritual teacher named Bashar. Transcriptions of the event dialogue were generated by AWS Transcribe and then pre-formatted through custom scripts. Dialogue snippets can be searched for with keywords, and recordings of the dialogue can be listened to alongside realtime transcript highlighting. The web app also allows a second search option that will web scrape their website to find events where a certain question containing the specified keyword were asked. The app is created with NodeJS on the backend and React on the front. Event audio clips are stored in AWS S3.

                Tanks Game
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Meant to be quite a large scale game, this untitled tanks project was my legitimate attempt at a real video game made using C# and Unity, built from scratch. Lots of emphasis is placed on OOP concepts for various tank and enemy types, as well as various algorithm implementations used for destructible environments such as breadth first search graph traversal. Many core components of the game were achieved and some minor demo prototypes were created showing off combat, destruction and objectives, but eventually the project was put on hold due to school at the time, and now other priorities. It is my intention however to return to it at some point.

                Intented to make the most out of React, Planni is a planner and advanced note taking application. It has been put to a temporary hault, but still a lot of work has gone into the DynamoDB table and index design, React component layout, and various interconnected pieces. The website is split into two interfaces: planner and notes and includes adding monthly tasks, updating planners with different styles, notes and reminders, bulleted lists, images, filters for organization and highlighting.

                Used as my capstone project for my Associate's Degree, Snappir is meant to act as a social platform for landscape and cityscape photos. You can sign up and upload your own photos, comment on other posts, message and follow other users and show support by liking and favoriting posts. The site features infinite scrolling and post filtering, as well as Google Maps integration. This was my first implementation of some of these concepts and an app of this size, so of course many parts of the app aren't quite optimal. Written with NodeJS and MongoDB as the database.

                Created with Java and Android Studio, this Android app acts as an assistant for tracking your fluid and caffeine intake. Specific goals can be set, and a simple slider interface allows you to easily update progress. Specific containers can be added, such as the volume of a mug or water bottle, to make updates easier and quicker. This was made as a final project, and as so some anticipated features and fixes weren't added in time.

                This was a prototype built with C++ and Unreal Engine years ago, and was made alongside an online course. This project was a way of utilizing C++ and various libraries to create a controllable and shootable tank in a sandbox environment, along with AI tanks to battle. No build was officially created but the Git Repo tracks all of my progression of the complex development.
